# ControlTap Console Variants
## Standalone Console
The standalone ControlTap console is for situations where it does not make sense to create a direct connection to the attached equipment for various reasons:
- Equipment power or control systems are located far away from the user area (usually more than 6 feet) or a power/data cable cannot be routed between the equipment controls and the user area due to physical access restrictions.
- Equipment does not have a suitable control (power or data) interface to tie into.

## Standard Console
The standard ControlTap console can be utilized for most situations that require power or data interuptions, or indirectly read equipment status that trigger audible or visible alarms. The Standard console interfaces with any ControlTap External module via direct connection.

## USB Console
The USB ControlTap console allows on/off control of a group of two USB 2.0 ports, usually associated with keyboard+mouse control. The ControlTap Console (and connected USB devices) are powered and talk to the host computer via a single USB cable.
**Note:** *At this time, ControlTap USB Hub Console can provide a maximum combined current of 300mA to connected USB devices.*
