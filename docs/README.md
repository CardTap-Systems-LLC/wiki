# ControlTap Console
The ControlTap Console can be used in two different configurations: **Standard** and **Standalone**.
## Standard (Wired)
Utilized for most situations that require power or data interuptions. The Standard console interfaces with any ControlTap Module module capable of direct (wired) connection.
## Standalone (Wireless)
For situations where it does not make sense to create a direct connection to the attached equipment:
- Equipment power or control systems are located far away from the Console (usually more than 6 feet) or a power/data cable cannot be routed between the equipment controls and the Console due to physical access restrictions.
- 120V outlet control is required.
- Equipment does not have a suitable control (power or data) interface to tie into.

## USB Console
The USB ControlTap console allows on/off control of a group of two USB 2.0 ports, usually associated with keyboard+mouse control. The ControlTap Console (and connected USB devices) are powered and talk to the host computer via a single USB cable.
**Note:** *At this time, ControlTap USB Hub Console can provide a maximum combined current of 300mA to connected USB devices.*
